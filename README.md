WRT and SSR Reports

The WRT report utilizes a combination of VBA for automated data registration, multiple pivot tables, and comprehensive Excel formulas. This setup allows us to analyze the data from various perspectives.

The SSR report, or Stock Sell-out report, provides an overview of our stock levels and items sold to date. It leverages pivot tables and Excel formulas for detailed analysis.
